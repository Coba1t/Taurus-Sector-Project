Name: Shadowsong

Background:

Overview:
Shadowsong is a support that joins your party in the late game. He thrives in extended fights and when enemies that deal most of their damage through physical attacks. Shadowsong is very fragile and his spells all have an enormous mana cost, but both flaws are mitigated through night rejuvenation. Nightfall, Shadowsong's signature passive, allows him to heavily punish attacking enemies. His other spells are also very strong in certain situations: cloak of darkness dramatically increases his teammates’ evasion over time, shadowgaze can permanently stun an enemy while also dealing massive damage, and dark harmony can potentially save allies on the brink of death, bringing them back to the battlefield with full health and mana. His ultimate ability, melody of shadows, completely devastates enemies by immediately applying multiple stacks of his normal spells, given that the player is willing to sacrifice his life in exchange. Beware, though: enemy casters completely destroy Shadowsong, since they are not affected by the majority of his abilities with the exception of his stun.

Melody of Shadows (R)
All
Shadowsong sings his final melody, and immediately falls and loses all HP.

Finally, allies are given 3 special stacks of cloak that last for 4 rounds when they awaken, and all nightfall damage is triggered when the shadowgaze duration ends.
