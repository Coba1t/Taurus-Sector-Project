Name: Arcanus II, the Stormcaster

Background:

Overview:
Stormcaster is an versatile glass cannon/crowd controller that joins your party relatively early. He has pitiful physical damage, but ungodly magical output. Stormcaster's innate, Sinister Intellect, attempts to balance his long casting times by allowing him to regain concentration even when being attacked by an enemy. His passive, essence of the storm, is Stormcaster's only method of conserving ammunition for his spells, and is also a good supporting ability for active teammates. His active spells focus on dealing damage and control through the elements: perpetual inferno does fire damage to all enemies, ethereal hail can stun an enemy while also doing freeze damage over time, and heavenly lightning deals a great amount of shock damage to a single target. Stormcaster's ultimate, Dracones Elementorum, is a lengthy casting spell that summons three divine dragons that severely damage enemies' HP, mana, and speed. Magic immunity is Stormcaster's greatest enemy, as these enemies are completely protected from the effects of Stormcaster's entire skill set.
